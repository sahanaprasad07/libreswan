test connection switching. A conn "distraction" is loaded that
looks like it could match, but it doesn't. east needs to
figure this out after the SAN does not match and switch to the
real conn. This looks like:

"distraction"[1] 192.1.2.45 #1: X509: CERT payload does not match connection ID
"distraction"[1] 192.1.2.45 #1: switched from "distraction"[1] 192.1.2.45 to "westnet-eastnet"
"westnet-eastnet"[1] 192.1.2.45 #1: deleting connection "distraction"[1] 192.1.2.45 instance with peer 192.1.2.45 {isakmp=#0/ipsec=#0}
"westnet-eastnet"[1] 192.1.2.45 #1: Peer ID is ID_DER_ASN1_DN: 'C=CA, ST=Ontario, L=Toronto, O=Libreswan, OU=Test Department, CN=west.testing.libreswan.org, E=user-west@testing.libreswan.org'
